About Dataset
This dataset contains a list of video games dating from 1980 to 2023, it also provides things such as release dates, user review rating, and critic review rating.

Not only can you find the popular games mentioned here but also the obscure indie ones which we have forgotten in time!

Backloggd is a video game collection website mixed with social elements to focus on bringing your gaming profile to life. Create a free account to get started on logging the games you've played, and then rating and reviewing as you go! Go into detail with logging platforms, time played, and even a daily journal to keep track your daily gaming progress with playthroughs. It's all tailored to how much you want to log, so that your profile fits you. Then outside of that you can create lists of games, friend other users, follow their activities, and so much more!

Inspiration

The purpose of this dataset is to gain insights into the trends of game genre popularity.

I am particularly interested in the following questions:

Which game genres are the most popular?

What are the trends in popularity for each game genre?

Can we identify any relationship between plot, genre, and popularity?

Can we use generative NLP to generate catchy game titles or plots?

Which games are users inclined to play right now and which ones do they keep hanging in their game shelves?
